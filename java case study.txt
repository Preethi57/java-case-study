The Dukeâ€™s Bookstore example is a simple e-commerce application that illustrates some of the more advanced features of JavaServer Faces technology in combination with Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE Platform (CDI), enterprise beans, and the Java Persistence API. Users can select books from an image map, view the bookstore catalog, and purchase books. No security is used in this application.
